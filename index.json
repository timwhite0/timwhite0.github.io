This task was historically performed through manual annotation, but the advent of high-throughput imaging techniques in recent decades has prompted a shift away from this labor-intensive approach and toward automated detection algorithms. Software pipelines such as CellProfiler and ImageJ are commonly used for routine segmentation due to their relatively simple interfaces, but deep learning methods are the current state of the art among cell detection algorithms, as architectures based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to excel at characterizing cells and tissues in microscopy images. However, successful training of these deep networks requires a high volume of manually segmented example images, and their applicability to specific cell or tissue types is limited to those that are represented in the training set. In addition, these models are not well suited for analyzing images that depict dense regions of clustered or overlapping cells, as the point estimates they produce do not capture the inherent ambiguity of cell positions and properties in crowded images.\nThe Bayesian paradigm is a potentially convenient alternative in this setting because it provides calibrated uncertainty estimates for ambiguous images and enables biomedical experts to incorporate prior information based on their domain knowledge. A typical Bayesian approach to this task is to treat the pixel intensities of an image as observed random variables x and the properties of the imaged objects as latent random variables z, and to characterize the posterior distribution p(z | x) via Monte Carlo samples or a variational approximation. This is a challenging environment for inference because it is inherently transdimensional — the number of cells in a microscopy image is generally not known a priori, and hence the number of unknown model parameters to infer is itself unknown. As such, most previous attempts to tackle cell detection through a Bayesian lens have relied on transdimensional sampling algorithms. Perhaps the most prominent example is the work of Al-Awadhi et al., who used birth-death Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, the transdimensional proposals required by these algorithms are notoriously difficult to design and may result in slow mixing if they are designed poorly.\nMotivated by the shortcomings of deterministic software pipelines, CNNs, and transdimensional MCMC algorithms, we propose a novel approach to probabilistic cell detection for crowded fluorescence microscopy images. Our approach, which is based on likelihood-tempered sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers, leverages the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPU computing, and it does not require the user to design, or subsequently sample from, transdimensional proposals. The remainder of this report is guided by the following objectives: (1) Determine the necessary components of a realistic Bayesian model of cells in microscopy images and design an efficient SMC sampler to target the posterior distribution induced by this model; (2) assess the statistical and computational performance of our SMC sampler in a simulation study involving synthetic images generated from a simplified version of our Bayesian model; and (3) compare the accuracy and calibration of our sampler’s posterior estimates for several relevant cell detection metrics to a popular open-source cell segmentation pipeline based on thresholding and the watershed algorithm.\n","date":1714435200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714435200,"objectID":"0276f9725806b24438b123a1f880ec31","permalink":"https://timwhite0.github.io/project/biostat882project/","publishdate":"2024-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/biostat882project/","section":"project","summary":"BIOSTAT 882 final project, University of Michigan.","tags":null,"title":"Sequential Monte Carlo for probabilistic cell detection in microscopy images","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Waste-free sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is an extension of SMC that was recently proposed by Dau and Chopin (2022).

These objects are known as blends. Distinguishing and characterizing blended light sources is a challenging task, as there is inherent ambiguity in the type, position, and properties of each source. We propose SMC-Deblender, a novel approach to probabilistic astronomical cataloging based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Given an image, SMC-Deblender evaluates catalogs with various source counts by partitioning the SMC particles into blocks. With this technique, we demonstrate that SMC can be a viable alternative to existing deblending methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational inference. In experiments with ambiguous synthetic images of crowded starfields, SMC-Deblender accurately detects and deblends sources, a task which proves infeasible for Source Extractor, a widely used non-probabilistic cataloging program.","tags":["sequential Monte Carlo","astronomical images","deblending"],"title":"Sequential Monte Carlo for detecting and deblending objects in astronomical images","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Weather prediction is a notoriously challenging task due to the uncertainty inherent in dynamic meteorological systems. It is not uncommon for short-term forecasts of temperature, precipitation, and other conditions to be off the mark — these errors are a nuisance for everyday human activity and can negatively impact sectors like aviation and tourism. Weather forecasts have traditionally been made by using supercomputers to simulate massive physical systems based on complex meteorological equations. This approach is known as numerical weather prediction, and it has been the predominant forecasting method for decades.\nIn recent years, however, meteorologists, computer scientists, and statisticians have discovered that deep neural networks are a powerful tool for producing accurate weather forecasts. As a result, there has been a shift away from numerical weather prediction and toward models based on machine learning. Our focus in this report is on the latter — we train models to predict temperature and precipitation up to four days into the future for 21 cities throughout the United States. Specifically, we produce forecasts of the minimum, average, and maximum daily temperature in these cities, as well as whether it snowed and whether any precipitation occurred. We develop a transparent and reproducible workflow via Git and Docker — our models can be trained (and retrained, if desired) and run on a daily basis to make predictions for the next four days in each city.\n","date":1701648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701648000,"objectID":"9a18888a5ddb13f130b3ab31485d3045","permalink":"https://timwhite0.github.io/project/stats604weather/","publishdate":"2023-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/stats604weather/","section":"project","summary":"STATS 604 project \\#4, University of Michigan.

It has been demonstrated that there is an association between the perceived creativity of a work of art and its overall quality, but the underlying factors that shape individuals’ perceptions of creativity are not well-established. This discrepancy is the central focus of a recent article published in Nature’s Scientific Reports, in which Spee et al. attempt to identify the perceived attributes of a work of art — e.g., color, symbolism, emotion — that contribute most heavily to individuals’ assessments of its creativity.\nSpee et al. conducted a study in which 78 non-experts were asked to rate 54 paintings according to 17 different attributes, each on a 100-point scale. The participants were also asked to judge the creativity of each painting on the same 100-point scale. The authors trained a random forest regression model to analyze these data, emphasizing that this approach is well-suited for capturing the nonlinear relationships that are thought to exist between creativity and the selected attributes. Their results support this hypothesis of nonlinearity and suggest that symbolism, emotionality, and imaginativeness are the most prominent predictors of creativity in Western paintings.

Diabetes-related mortality is prevalent across a wide range of sociodemographic subpopulations, and many previous studies have attempted to identify the risk factors and comorbidities that contribute most heavily to this phenomenon. However, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the distinction between the type 1 and type 2 variants of the disease in the context of mortality. In this report, we fill this gap in the literature by using unsupervised and supervised statistical learning methods to analyze the mortality risk profiles of individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We apply a dimension reduction technique to multiple-cause-of-death mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to explore the latent sociodemographic and health profiles of individuals whose deaths were attributed to diabetes in 2021, and we train several classification models to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes as a cause of death based on these characteristics. Our results suggest that sophisticated classification methods are capable of achieving moderate accuracy in distinguishing deaths due to type 1 diabetes from those due to type 2 diabetes, with tree-based and optimization-based classifiers such as random forest, AdaBoost, and kernel SVM providing a better holistic performance than model-based classifiers such as naive Bayes, quadratic discriminant analysis, and penalized logistic regression. We find that age is the most useful predictor for this classification task, followed by other sociodemographic predictors such as education, marital status, race, place of death, and sex. These findings provide important insights that could potentially improve the ability of practitioners to assess mortality risk in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n","date":1682553600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682553600,"objectID":"1258b58947e0b5ba84412f6473a79a14","permalink":"https://timwhite0.github.io/project/stats601project/","publishdate":"2023-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/stats601project/","section":"project","summary":"STATS 601 final project, University of Michigan.","tags":null,"title":"Analyzing mortality and its determinants among individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes","type":"project"},{"authors":["Tim White","Sara Algeri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1676419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676419200,"objectID":"c1dafe84af13e540693a386f0b3e239d","permalink":"https://timwhite0.github.io/publication/white_algeri_2022/","publishdate":"2023-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/white_algeri_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"False positive results in screening tests have potentially severe psychological, medical, and financial consequences for the recipient. However, there have been few efforts to quantify how the risk of a false positive accumulates over time. We seek to fill this gap by estimating the probability that an individual who adheres to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening guidelines will receive at least one false positive in a lifetime. To do so, we assembled a data set of 116 studies cited by the USPSTF that report the number of true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives for the primary screening procedure for one of five cancers or six sexually transmitted diseases. We use these data to estimate the probability that an individual in one of 14 demographic subpopulations will receive at least one false positive for one of these eleven diseases in a lifetime. We specify a suitable statistical model to account for the hierarchical structure of the data, and we use the parametric bootstrap to quantify the uncertainty surrounding our estimates. The estimated probability of receiving at least one false positive in a lifetime is 85.5% (±0.9%) and 38.9% (±3.6%) for baseline groups of women and men, respectively. It is higher for subpopulations recommended to screen more frequently than the baseline, including more vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and men who have sex with men. Since screening technology is imperfect, false positives remain inevitable. The high lifetime risk of a false positive reveals the importance of educating patients about this phenomenon.","tags":null,"title":"Estimating the lifetime risk of a false positive screening test result","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tim White","Sara Algeri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1659967200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659967200,"objectID":"97cb117800cfc046dc32494bfb39c5ab","permalink":"https://timwhite0.github.io/talk/estimating-the-lifetime-risk-of-a-false-positive-screening-test-result/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/estimating-the-lifetime-risk-of-a-false-positive-screening-test-result/","section":"event","summary":"Student paper competition for ASA Section on Medical Devices and Diagnostics, 2022 Joint Statistical Meetings.","tags":["false positive","screening test","bootstrap","R Shiny","US Preventive Services Task Force"],"title":"Estimating the lifetime risk of a false positive screening test result","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"MLBdash is an R Shiny dashboard with projected standings and team statistics dating back to 1998.\nThe first tab lists each team’s projected wins and losses, which are the average of the projections from Baseball Reference and Baseball Prospectus.
