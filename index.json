As such, the success of the algorithm often hinges on the initialization of the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$. Many different initialization strategies have been proposed in the literature — some are based on random initialization, others involve data-driven methods like singular value decomposition or K-means clustering, and a handful are highly sophisticated procedures that require considerable computational effort. Perhaps unsurprisingly, no single initialization scheme has been shown to consistently outperform the others across all Gaussian mixture model settings. In this report, we study a relatively general model setting with a moderate number of mixture components where the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ are treated as unknown. We consider four computationally feasible initialization methods, and we use simulation to assess the impact of these methods on the performance of the EM algorithm. In our simulation studies, we directly quantify the accuracy of the initial parameter values and characterize the post-initialization convergence behavior of the EM algorithm, and in doing so we build on earlier studies that focused primarily on the accuracy of the final EM estimates. Our results demonstrate that data-driven initialization strategies like svdEM (which uses singular value decomposition) and kmEM (which uses K-means clustering) tend to be more accurate and efficient than random initialization schemes, and in many settings they provide a reasonable alternative to more sophisticated but computationally intensive techniques. However, all of these initialization strategies tend to struggle when there is substantial overlap between the mixture components, especially when the dimension of the data is high. The optimal strategy for initializing $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ in this setting remains an open question.\n","date":1681430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681430400,"objectID":"bff7a115882ae67502c429995a24f2c8","permalink":"https://timwhite0.github.io/project/initializing_em/","publishdate":"2023-04-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/initializing_em/","section":"project","summary":"STATS 606 project, University of Michigan","tags":["Gaussian mixture models","EM algorithm","Optimization"],"title":"Efficient initialization of the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models","type":"project"},{"authors":["Tim White","Sara Algeri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1659967200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659967200,"objectID":"97cb117800cfc046dc32494bfb39c5ab","permalink":"https://timwhite0.github.io/talk/estimating-the-lifetime-risk-of-a-false-positive-screening-test-result/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/estimating-the-lifetime-risk-of-a-false-positive-screening-test-result/","section":"event","summary":"Presented in session \\#193 of JSM 2022 as part of the student paper competition for the ASA Section on Medical Devices and Diagnostics.","tags":["false positive","screening test","bootstrap","R Shiny","US Preventive Services Task Force"],"title":"Estimating the lifetime risk of a false positive screening test result","type":"event"},{"authors":["Tim White","Sara Algeri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654041600,"objectID":"c1dafe84af13e540693a386f0b3e239d","permalink":"https://timwhite0.github.io/publication/white_algeri_2022/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/white_algeri_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"False positive results in screening tests have potentially severe psychological, medical, and financial consequences for the recipient. However, there have been few efforts to quantify how the risk of a false positive accumulates over time. We seek to fill this gap by estimating the probability that an individual who adheres to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening guidelines will receive at least one false positive in a lifetime. To do so, we assembled a data set of 116 studies cited by the USPSTF that report the number of true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives for the primary screening procedure for one of five cancers or six sexually transmitted diseases. We use these data to estimate the probability that an individual in one of 14 demographic subpopulations will receive at least one false positive for one of these eleven diseases in a lifetime. We specify a suitable statistical model to account for the hierarchical structure of the data, and we use the parametric bootstrap to quantify the uncertainty surrounding our estimates. The estimated probability of receiving at least one false positive in a lifetime is 85.5% (±0.9%) and 38.9% (±3.6%) for baseline groups of women and men, respectively. It is higher for subpopulations recommended to screen more frequently than the baseline, including more vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and men who have sex with men. Since screening technology is imperfect, false positives remain inevitable. The high lifetime risk of a false positive reveals the importance of educating patients about this phenomenon.","tags":["false positive","screening test","bootstrap","U.S. Preventive Services Task Force"],"title":"Estimating the lifetime risk of a false positive screening test result","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As massive data sets become more and more prevalent across the sciences, there is a growing need for accurate and computationally efficient methods of estimator quality assessment that can be applied under a variety of data-generating conditions. The nonparametric bootstrap is a straightforward and accurate method for approximating the sampling distribution of an estimator, but it becomes computationally unwieldy for large samples. Kleiner et al.’s bag of little bootstraps (BLB) provides a computationally efficient alternative to the bootstrap, but it is not expected to perform well in settings where the bootstrap is inconsistent. In this paper, we introduce the bag of little m out of n bootstraps (BLmnB), a modification of the BLB that aims to extend the method’s applicability to cases of bootstrap inconsistency. We formalize the BLmnB algorithm and compare its performance against that of the bootstrap and the BLB in two well-documented settings of bootstrap failure. Our results indicate that while the BLmnB is capable of outperforming the other two methods in one of these settings, it performs no better than the BLB in the other. In both settings, we find that the approximation accuracy of the BLmnB is sensitive to the choice of the resample size m. While these findings suggest that the BLmnB is a promising alternative to the BLB in at least some data- generating scenarios, further investigation is necessary in order to develop the underlying theory of the method and study its accuracy and runtime in other settings of bootstrap inconsistency.\n","date":1652140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652140800,"objectID":"5a74aee7f64b85ade4e4f8039171dece","permalink":"https://timwhite0.github.io/project/honors_thesis/","publishdate":"2022-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/honors_thesis/","section":"project","summary":"Undergraduate honors thesis, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities","tags":["resampling","bootstrap","simulation"],"title":"A resampling technique for massive data in settings of bootstrap inconsistency","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Hugo Blox Builder Hugo Blox Builder | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
